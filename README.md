# JTune - a high precision Java CMS optimizer

Overview
--------

JTune is a tool that will help you tune and troubleshoot a running JVM (Java 6 - Java 8) without restarting. It currently doesn't work with G1 (it will error out if it sees it). It bases it's tuning on two metrics: the aggregate time spent doing GCs, and the stdev of the GCs. Upon invocation, it'll capture the output of jstat for the given pid as well as the GC log data during the sample period.

Options Help
------------

Normally you can run jtune.py with the -p \<pid> parameter, and it'll run indefinitely. When you're ready for it to report what it found, you can hit CTRL-C, and it'll print out the summary of what it found (including recommendations if it sees any). There are additional options that you can take advantage of. See below output:
    
    $ jtune.py -h
    usage: jtune.py [-h] [-o OPTIMIZE] [-P] [-s FGC_STOP_COUNT]
                     [-y YGC_STOP_COUNT] [-c STOP_COUNT] [-n] (-r [FILE] | -p PID)
    
    Run jstat w/ analytics
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -o OPTIMIZE, --optimize OPTIMIZE
                            Optimize for latency or throughput (range 0-11, 0 =
                            ygc @ 180/min, 11 = ygc @ 1/min). Floats allowed.
      -P, --no-paste        Don't save the screen output to the paste service
      -s FGC_STOP_COUNT, --fgc-stop-count FGC_STOP_COUNT
                            How many full gcs should happen before I stop (very
                            important for analytics)
      -y YGC_STOP_COUNT, --ygc-stop-count YGC_STOP_COUNT
                            How many young gcs should happen before I stop
      -c STOP_COUNT, --stop-count STOP_COUNT
                            How many iterations of jstat to run before stopping
      -n, --no-jstat-output
                            Do not show jstat output - only print summary
      -r [FILE], --replay [FILE]
                            Replay a previously saved default is
                            /tmp/jtune_data-{user}.bin.bz2 file
      -p PID, --pid PID     Which java PID should I attach to

* You can also have it stop after X number of YGCs, FGCs, or jstat iterations (-y, -s, -c respectively). If you want it to make tuning suggestions, you'll want to let it run for at least 3 FGCs (-s <#>) before exiting.
* There may be cases where you want jtune to optimize for a given number of CMS GCs, you can do this with the '-o #' parameter. Right now you can specify a range between 0 and 11 which corresponds to the 180 CMS/min to 1 CMS/min respectively. In most cases you can leave it as default. The way this parameter is used will likely change.
* There may be cases where you see something odd in the suggestions, or want to save the data structures jtune.py used for further analysis. By default jtune saves this data in /tmp/jtune_data-{user}.bin.bz2. JTune can replay this file by passing it a -r \<path\> parameter.

Command Output
--------------

Here's an example run of a jtune run for a test instance (broken up into chunks)

* Here's what you see as jtune.py is running (jtune.py -c 40 -p 25815).  JTune will run for 40 iterations, exit, and report it's findings:

```
$ jtune.py -c 40 -p 25815

* This section provides what analysis it was able to do. For it to do a very accurate/detailed analysis, you need to let it run long enough to capture at least 3 FGCs. It will warn you if it doesn't have enough data, and will not do analysis in a specific area if there is insufficient data. Here you can see that there wasn't enough FGCs.

```
Recommendation Summary:
-----------------------
Warning: There were only 8 YGC entries to do the analysis on. It's better to
have > 10 to get more realistic results.


* Error: Your survivor age is too short, your last age of 2 has 63.89% of it's
objects still alive. Unset or increase the MaxTenuringThreshold to mitigate this
problem.


---
* The allocation rate is the increase is usage before a GC done. Growth rate
  is the increase in usage after a GC is done.

* The JVM efficiency score is a convenient way to quantify how efficient the
  JVM is. The most efficient JVM is 100% (pretty much impossible to obtain).

* There were no full GCs during this sample period. This reporting will
  be less useful/accurate as a result.

* A copy of the critical data used to generate this report is stored
  in /tmp/jtune_data-{user}.bin.bz2. Please copy this to your homedir if you
  want to save/analyze this further.

FAQ
---
```
Q: Do I have to run jtune.py as root?
A: You should run it as the user of the Java process you want to analyze (or root).

Q: What versions of Java does this support?
A: JTune works with Java versions 6-8.

Q: What JVM options should I have turned on to property use this tool?
A: You should have the following enabled: -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution,
   -XX:+PrintGCDetails, and -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps

Q: Can it tune the G1 GC?
A: Not at this time. G1 is quite a bit harder to tweak, but it's work in progress.
```

Footnotes
---------
* JTune has been thorougly tested against the many services at LinkedIn, and has shown to be very effective. If your application is vastly different from the norm, please involve me (Eric Bullen) if you have any concerns. Please save the jtune_data-{user}.bin.bz file for later analysis.
* JTulse reads the GC logs after you press CTRL-C, so if the GC log file rotates during analysis, only partial data will be available.
